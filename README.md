# joulebot_rpi - raspberry pi chatbot

Create a keys.py with OPENAI_KEY = 'your api string'.

Pip install openai, flask

then python main.py.  I wrote this to run on a raspberry pi, so it's pretty minimal, but you can run it on whatever hardware you like.  It has both a web service (localhost:5000) or you can use the console prompt.  Type 'quit' in the console to shut everything down cleanly.
